<p>
    This chart shows information on the sleep duration average for varying ages of individuals.
    <br>
    We can see based on the coloring of the bar that 53 year olds have the highest sleep duration. 34 year olds have the lowest sleep duration.
    <br>
    We can observe here that on average individuals who are closer to the end of their careers 
    sleep longer than individuals closer to the start of their careers. 
    <br>
    This seems logical given that individuals may be speding more time advancing their careers
    at a younger age and may spend less time dedicated to work, therefore are able to sleep longer at the age of 53.
