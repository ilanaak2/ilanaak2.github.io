    <div class="tooltip"></div>
    <div> 
        <input type="checkbox" id="maleYes">
        <label for="maleYes">male</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="femaleYes">
        <label for="femaleYes">female</label>
    </div>
    <p>
        We can see here a chart the displays the average time people spend on physical activity given an occupation.
        <br>
        This chart provides user interactivity and can be filtered out by selecting the check box for male, female, or both.
        <br>
        When female is selected, we see the occupation that does the most physical activity is a doctor.
        <br>
        When male is selected, we see the occupation that does the most physical activity is an engineer.
        <br>
        When female and male is selected, we see the occupation that does the most physical activity is a nurse.
        Logically, we see that occupations that involve being on your feet for long period of time achieve the most physical activity.
